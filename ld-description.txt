# üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Game, Genie! It's Crunch Time üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è#


I can show you the world... of game development!

Making a game shining, shimmering, splendid is a lot easier when you've got a genie doing the work for you.


**Collect colorful items** and use your **special abilities** to fend off enemies in a **billiards-style bounce-fest**.

Use your abilities to get each type of item into its respective genie's goal as you playtest the game you're developing over the game jam weekend.
